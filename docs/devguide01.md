## Prerequisites

Usage of the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`ConditionalTokens` </span> smart contract requires some
proficiency in [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io).

Additionally, this guide will assume a
[Truffle](https://truffleframework.com) based setup. Client-side code
samples will be written in JavaScript assuming the presence of a
[web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) instance and various
[TruffleContract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/next/packages/truffle-contract#truffle-contract)
wrappers.

The current state of this smart contract may be found on
[Github](https://github.com/gnosis/conditional-tokens-contracts).

## Installation

This developmental framework may be installed from Github through NPM by
