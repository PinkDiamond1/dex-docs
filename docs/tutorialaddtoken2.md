## Requirements
1. In order to pay for the costs for listing a new token, you need to have 10 [OWL](https://blog.gnosis.pm/owl-token-use-cases-6094027ecb37) available at your disposal.

	a. Get OWL using [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.link), the first dapp built on Gnosis Protocol.

	b. [Get OWL using](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) on Uniswap. You must manually enter the [OWL token address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a5f9352af8af974bfc03399e3767df6370d82e4).

2. Make sure you have have some ETH available for gas fees available. If you're using the [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io), you can also pay gas fees using other tokens.
3. Lastly, have the token address of the token you would like to list readily available. Make sure the token you'd like to list is compliant with the [ERC-20 token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md), as this compliance will not be checked on smart contract level.
