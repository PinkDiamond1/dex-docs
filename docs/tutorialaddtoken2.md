## Requirements
1. In order to pay for the costs for adding the new token, you need to have 10 [OWL](https://blog.gnosis.pm/owl-token-use-cases-6094027ecb37) available at your disposal 

	a. Get OWL here on the Dfusion  [link coming]

	b. [Get OWL here](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) on Uniswap (by entering the [OWL address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a5f9352af8af974bfc03399e3767df6370d82e4) manually)

2. Have some ETH for gas available (or other tokens in case you are using the Gnosis Safe and pay your gas costs in another token)
3. Know the token address of the token you would like to add; be sure it complies with the [ERC20 token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) (this is not checked on smart contract level)
