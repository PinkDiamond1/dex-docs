Before you get started, make sure you've familiarized yourself with the Gnosis Protocol [introduction](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/docs/introduction1).

Gnosis Protocol is a fully permissionless DEX, and anyone can list any token compliant with the ERC-20 technical standard. **For a token to be tradeable on the protocol, first it must be listed**. Once listed on the protocol, a token cannot be unlisted.

In this tutorial, we will teach you how to list GNO on Gnosis Protocol using Etherscan. The process described in the tutorial can be used to list all other ERC-20 tokens as well. 

**Note:**  Listing a token as per this tutorial on the smart contract level, does not mean it becomes available on a graphical user interface (UI). To list a token, there is a cost 10 OWL, plus gas fees.

This tutorial will cover the following steps in order to list ERC-20 tokens on the protocol:
1. Getting Started 
2. Obtaining OWL 
3. Approving the token contract
4. Listing the ERC-20 token
5. Optional step: Verification 
6. Optional step: Retrieving the token ID
