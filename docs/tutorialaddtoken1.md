Before you get started you should have read the Dfusion introduction.  
The dFusion protocol is fully decentralized and anyone can add any ERC20 compliant token to it, once added, the tokens cannot be removed. **For a token to become tradeable it first must be added**. Within this tutorial we will teach you how to add GNO to the dFusion Protocol using Etherscan. The steps described can be applied to any other ERC20 token. 

**Note:**  Adding a token as per this tutorial (on the smart contract) does not mean it becomes available on a graphical user interface. The cost for performing this is 10OWL (plus usual gas)

This Tutorial will cover the following steps in order to add ERC20 tokens to the protocol:
1. Getting Started 
2. Obtaining OWL 
3. Approving the token contract
4. Adding the ERC20 token
5. Optional step: Verify 
6. Optional step: Getting the token ID
