In the Introduction we explained the basics concepts of the dFusion mechanism. Now we want to give an insight into a potential use case on how to use the dFusion protocol to provide liquidity of stable coins, while making use of the fluctuation around 1USD.  
USD stablecoins are cryptographic tokens with the purpose of providing a low volatility asset by being roughly pegged to 1 USD. In fact, they are not always 1 USD, but fluctuate around 1 USD with varying discrepancy. By creating standing orders on the dFusion protocoll, this spread can be exploited. 

The concept can be put into action through the interface of dFusion protocol but also can be purely done on the contract level. A tutorial therefore will be provided soon. The following description will give an informational summary on the simple liquidity provision concept.
