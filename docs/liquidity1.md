In the introduction to Gnosis Protocol, we explained the basic premises of how the protocol works. Now, we'd like to illustrate a potential use case through providing liquidity for stablecoins, while making use of their fluctuation around 1 USD.  

USD stablecoins are crypto tokens with the purpose of providing a low volatility asset by being roughly pegged to 1 USD. In practice, stablecoins are not always exactly 1 USD, but fluctuate around 1 USD with varying discrepancy. You could exploit this spread by creating standing orders on Gnosis Protocol. 

This strategy could be put into action through a dapp built on Gnosis Protocol, but also executed purely on the smart contract level. Check out the next section for a basic summary on this simple liquidity provision concept.
